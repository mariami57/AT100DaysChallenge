## Troubleshooting Guide

1. Books Not Processing / PDFs Are Not Being Processed
- Possible Causes:
    - PDFs not located in correct directory
    - Incorrect BASE_DIR usage 
    - File path mismatch
    Verify path in command:
    <pre>
    books_dir = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'lms_app', 'books')
    </pre>
    Make sure this directory exists and contains .pdf files.

2. PDF Text Extraction Issues
Extracted text is empty
  Possible Causes:
    - Some PDFs are scanned images (not text-based)
    - PyPDF2 cannot extract text from image PDFs

   Fix:
     - Use OCR tools such as:
     - Tesseract
     - OCR-based preprocessing

3. Cohere Errors
- Authentication Error
    <pre>
    401 Unauthorized
    </pre>
   Cause:
    Invalid or missing COHERE_API_KEY.

   Fix:
    Ensure environment variable is set:
    <pre>
    echo $COHERE_API_KEY
    </pre>

- Rate Limit Error
    <pre>
    429 Too Many Requests
    </pre>
    Cause:
    Cohere rate limit exceeded.
    Fix:
    - Reduce batch size
    - Add retry logic
    - Check Cohere dashboard for quota limits

4. Pinecone Errors
- Index Not Found
    Cause:
    Index does not exist.
    Fix:
    initialize_pinecone_index() should create it automatically.
    Ensure PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT is correct.

  - Dimension Mismatch
  If embedding model changes dimension, Pinecone index must match.
  Current dimension:
    <pre>
    dimension = 1024
    </pre>
    If model changes, update index accordingly.

5. Duplicate Book Processing
   - Books Process Multiple Times
   Processing logic checks:
    <pre>
    if created or not book.embedding_id:
    </pre>
    If embedding_id is empty, the book will reprocess.

   Verify:
   - embedding_id is properly saved
   - Database is persistent

6. API Issues
- 404 on /api/books/

    Ensure:
    - Router is registered
    - URLs are included
    - DRF installed

- 500 Internal Server Error

    Check:
    - python manage.py runserver
    - Review traceback in console.

7. Chunking Issues
- Text Seems Truncated or Overlapping Incorrectly

    Chunking logic:
    <pre>
    chunk_size = 500
    overlap = 100
    </pre>
  
    Adjust values if:
    - Context too small
    - Overlap too large

8. Performance Issues
- Slow Processing
     Possible reasons:
      -  Large PDFs
      - Large batch sizes
      - Network latency to Pinecone

     Solutions:
      - Reduce batch_size
      - Process books asynchronously
      - Add logging to identify bottlenecks
